### note: these scripts assume you are using the msvc compiler

Run these build scripts from the project root, so they would be ran as ./resources/buildscripts/windows/debug.ps1

If you change the name of the project in the root CMakeLists.txt, update the scripts to execute the new name of the final binary.
