### note: these scripts assume you are using the msvc compiler and the ninja multi-config generator

Run these build scripts from the project root, so they would be ran as "resources/buildscripts/windows/debug" from a command  prompt

If you change the name of the project in the root CMakeLists.txt, update the scripts to execute the new name of the final binary.
